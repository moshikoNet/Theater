# Theater

This project extends the challenge given in section 11 of the “Java Programming Masterclass covering Java 11 & Java 17”.
The challenge was to create a theater with seats and give the option to reserve them.
I extended the requirements by adding a Visitor class with the following capabilities: bank account (including transactions history & account balance), reservations that allows muti reservations (every reservation seat include conformation key.
Also, the main menu allows easy reservation of a seat in each show, cancelation of a reservation, reviewing the visitor account balance and choosing a show from the list of shows showing in the theater.
  
In this project I used: ArrayList, LinkedList, Generics, Scanner and Math utilities, casting (String to int), etc.
